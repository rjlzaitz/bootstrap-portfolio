		<h2>Heenan Construction Logo</h2>
		
		<p>Heenan Construction is a new, family owned business operating out of Missouri. They needed a logo, so I met with them to get a feel for what they do and I began the process by doing sketches, refining my favorites and presenting roughs. From there we picked a couple concepts to finesse, then finally landed on the logo you see below. It's representative of a 2 point perspective structure, it evokes a feeling of sturdiness and strength. Overall, the client was very pleased with the outcome and used the logo on business cards, shirts and their vehicles.</p>
